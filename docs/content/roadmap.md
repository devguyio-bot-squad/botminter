# Roadmap

botminter is developed through incremental milestones. Each milestone builds on the previous one, adding features to the CLI and validating them with synthetic test tasks before operational use.

!!! warning "Pre-Alpha"
    botminter is under active development and not yet ready for production use. The information on this page reflects the current plan and is subject to change.

## Milestone overview

## Milestone 1: Structure + human-assistant

**Status**: Complete

Built the foundational infrastructure:

- Profile skeleton — process-agnostic directory structure
- `scrum` profile — PROCESS.md, CLAUDE.md, team knowledge/invariants
- human-assistant member skeleton with three-hat model
- Workspace model — clone project, embed team repo, surface config
- Human-in-the-loop (HIL) round-trip via Telegram (RObot)

**Proved**: Inner loop works (Ralph + hats). Workspace model works (clone, surface, run). HIL works (human <> human-assistant via Telegram, training mode).

## Milestone 1.5: Autonomous Ralph

**Status**: Complete (spike)

Validated how Ralph runs autonomously in a persistent loop, pulling work from a board instead of a single-objective prompt:

- `persistent: true` with `task.resume` routing
- Self-clearing scratchpad/tasks between work items
- Idle behavior via `LOOP_COMPLETE`

Deliverable: validated `ralph.yml` pattern adopted directly by M2.

## Milestone 2: Architect + First Epic

**Status**: Complete

Added the architect as a second team member and validated two-member coordination:

- Architect member skeleton (ralph.yml, PROMPT.md, CLAUDE.md, five hats)
- human-assistant evolution — new hats for epic creation, design gating
- Epic lifecycle statuses in PROCESS.md
- Two-member outer loop coordination validated with synthetic epics

**Proved**: Outer loop works (GitHub issues, status labels, knowledge resolution). Pull model works (architect picks up work via status watch). Two-member coordination works (PO (Product Owner) creates, architect designs, PO gates).

## Milestone 3: `bm` CLI

**Status**: Complete

Replaced Justfile-based tooling with a Rust CLI binary (`bm`):

- Single operator interface for managing agentic teams
- Workzone model with known, discoverable workspace directory
- Profile restructuring — collapsed into single layer with `botminter.yml` + `.schema/`
- Profiles embedded in the binary at compile time via `include_dir`
- Event-driven daemon with webhook and poll modes (`bm daemon start/stop/status`)
- Knowledge management commands (`bm knowledge list/show` + interactive mode)
- Formation-aware deployment (`bm start --formation`)
- Commands: `bm init`, `bm hire`, `bm start`, `bm stop`, `bm status`, `bm teams list/sync`, `bm members list`, `bm roles list`, `bm profiles list/describe`, `bm projects add`, `bm knowledge list/show`, `bm daemon start/stop/status`, `bm completions`
- Integration test suite covering full lifecycle, hire, sync, schema guard, multi-team

**Proved**: CLI-driven team management works. Versioned profile model enables future upgrades. Workzone model provides discoverability.

## Milestone 4: Full Team + First Story

**Status**: Planned

Adds dev, QE, and reviewer as team members:

- Dev, QE, reviewer member skeletons
- Full story kanban statuses in PROCESS.md
- TDD flow: QE writes tests, dev implements, QE verifies, reviewer reviews, architect signs off, PO merges
- Codebase access model (project fork, agent-cloned)
- First real knowledge accumulation

**Proves**: Pull-based coordination across all five members. TDD flow end-to-end. Knowledge accumulates and flows to the right scope.

## Milestone 5: Eval/Confidence System

**Status**: Planned

Formalizes the distributed eval framework:

- Eval framework across recursive scopes (team, project, member, member+project)
- Hard-gate vs advisory eval distinction
- Scored confidence metrics
- Evidence chain verification
- HIL graduation path (training, supervised, autonomous)

## GitHub Integration

**Status**: Complete (pulled forward from original M5)

Replaced file-based coordination with real GitHub:

- `gh` CLI calls replaced file operations (1:1 mapping)
- Unified `gh` skill as single interaction point
- Coordination model unchanged — only backing store moved

## Future ideas

- Extract human-assistant from profiles (infrastructure, not a team role)
- Access control per scope + SLSA-style attestation for PRs
- `ralph.yml` hot-reload (eliminate need for sync + restart)
- Knowledge observation mechanism for automatic knowledge capture
- Hat-level skill filtering (pending Ralph runtime support)
