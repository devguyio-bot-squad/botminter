# CLI Commands

All BotMinter operations use the `bm` CLI binary. Install it with `cargo install --path crates/bm` or build with `cargo build -p bm`.

## Team creation

### `bm init`

Interactive wizard — create a new team.

```bash
bm init
```

**Behavior:**

- Prompts for workzone directory, team name, and profile
- Auto-detects GitHub auth from `GH_TOKEN` env var or `gh auth token` — prompts only if none found
- Validates the token via `gh api user` before proceeding
- Lists GitHub orgs and personal account for interactive selection
- Offers to create a new repo or select an existing one from the chosen org
- Offers to create a new GitHub Project board or select an existing one
- For new repos: resolves the default coding agent from the profile, extracts the profile (filtering agent tags and renaming `context.md` to the agent's context file), optionally hires members and adds projects, creates GitHub repo and pushes
- For existing repos: clones the repo (skips member/project prompts — use `bm hire` and `bm projects add` after init)
- Registers the team in `~/.botminter/config.yml` early (before label/project operations) so a failure doesn't leave config in a broken state
- Bootstraps labels (idempotent via `--force`) and creates/syncs the GitHub Project board's Status field
- Stops with actionable error messages if any GitHub operation fails
- First registered team becomes the default

### Non-interactive mode

For scripted or CI usage:

```bash
bm init --non-interactive --profile <profile> --team-name <name> --org <org> --repo <repo> [--project <url>] [--workzone <path>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--non-interactive` | Yes | Run without interactive prompts |
| `--profile <profile>` | Yes | Profile name (e.g., `scrum-compact`) |
| `--team-name <name>` | Yes | Team identifier |
| `--org <org>` | Yes | GitHub org or user account |
| `--repo <repo>` | Yes | GitHub repo name |
| `--project <url>` | No | Project fork URL to add, or `new` to create a GitHub Project board |
| `--workzone <path>` | No | Override workzone directory (default: `~/.botminter/workspaces`) |

**Behavior:**

- Runs the full init flow without prompts
- Requires `GH_TOKEN` in the environment (auto-detected from `gh auth token` or env var)
- Creates the GitHub repo, bootstraps labels, creates a Project board, and registers the team
- In non-interactive mode, profile version mismatches are auto-resolved (same as `--force`)

## Member management

### `bm hire`

Hire a member into a role.

```bash
bm hire <role> [--name <name>] [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<role>` | Yes | Role name (must exist in the team's profile, e.g., `architect`) |
| `--name <name>` | No | Member name. Auto-generates a 2-digit suffix (e.g., `01`) if omitted |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on (defaults to default team) |

**Behavior:**

- Performs schema version guard (rejects if team schema doesn't match profile)
- Extracts member skeleton from the profile on disk into `team/{role}-{name}/`
- Finalizes `botminter.yml` with the member's name
- Creates a git commit (no auto-push)
- Auto-suffix fills gaps: if `01` and `03` exist, returns `02`

### `bm members list`

List hired members for a team.

```bash
bm members list [-t <team>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Scans `team/` directory for member directories
- Displays Member, Role, and Status columns
- Status reflects running/crashed/stopped from runtime state

### `bm members show`

Show detailed information about a member.

```bash
bm members show <member> [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<member>` | Yes | Member name (e.g., `architect-01`) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Displays member name, role, and runtime status (running/crashed/stopped)
- Shows PID, start time, and workspace path if running
- Shows workspace repo URL, branch, and per-submodule status (up-to-date/behind/modified) when workspace exists
- Shows resolved coding agent
- Lists knowledge and invariant files for the member

### `bm roles list`

List available roles from the team's profile.

```bash
bm roles list [-t <team>]
```

## Interactive sessions

### `bm chat`

Start an interactive chat session with a team member.

```bash
bm chat <member> [-t <team>] [--hat <hat>] [--render-system-prompt]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<member>` | Yes | Member name (e.g., `architect-01`) |
| `--hat <hat>` | No | Restrict to a specific hat (e.g., `executor`, `designer`) |
| `--render-system-prompt` | No | Print the generated system prompt and exit (no chat session) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Resolves the member's workspace and reads `ralph.yml` (guardrails, hat instructions) and `PROMPT.md` from it
- Builds a meta-prompt with role identity, hat capabilities, guardrails, role context, and reference paths
- **Three modes:**
    - `bm chat <member>` — hatless mode: agent has awareness of all hats, human drives the workflow
    - `bm chat <member> --hat executor` — hat-specific mode: agent is in character as that hat
    - `bm chat <member> --render-system-prompt` — prints the generated system prompt to stdout and exits (for debugging/inspection). Works with `--hat` too.
- In normal mode: writes the meta-prompt to a temp file and launches the coding agent with `--append-system-prompt-file`, which gives the meta-prompt higher authority than `CLAUDE.md`
- Requires a workspace created by `bm teams sync`

### `bm minty`

Launch Minty, the BotMinter interactive assistant.

```bash
bm minty [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on (gives Minty team-specific context) |

**Behavior:**

- Launches a coding agent session with Minty's persona prompt, running in the current working directory
- Minty is a thin persona shell — not a team member, not a Ralph instance — just a coding agent session primed with BotMinter knowledge
- **Works without any teams configured**: if `~/.botminter/` doesn't exist, Minty runs in "profiles-only" mode and can browse profiles and answer general questions, but team-specific commands are unavailable
- **Auto-initializes**: if Minty's config (`~/.config/botminter/minty/`) is not present, it is automatically extracted from the `bm` binary
- **Agent resolution**:
    - With `-t`: uses the team's configured coding agent
    - Without `-t`: uses the default coding agent from the first available profile on disk
- Uses `--append-system-prompt-file` to inject Minty's persona prompt, giving it higher authority than `CLAUDE.md`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Launch Minty in the current directory (no team needed)
bm minty

# Launch Minty with team-specific context
bm minty -t my-team
```

## Project management

### `bm projects list`

List projects configured for the team.

```bash
bm projects list [-t <team>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Reads `botminter.yml` and displays a table of Project and Fork URL columns
- If no projects are configured, prints guidance to use `bm projects add`

### `bm projects show`

```bash
bm projects show <project> [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<project>` | Yes | Project name |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<url>` | Yes | Git URL of the project fork |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Derives the project name from the URL basename (strips `.git` suffix)
- Appends to `botminter.yml` projects list
- Creates `projects/{name}/knowledge/` and `projects/{name}/invariants/` directories
- Creates a git commit (no auto-push)
- Errors if the project name already exists

### `bm projects sync`

Sync the GitHub Project board's Status field options with the profile definitions, and print instructions for setting up role-based views.

```bash
bm projects sync [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Finds the team's GitHub Project board by title (`{team} Board`)
- Updates the built-in Status field options to match the profile's `statuses` definitions using the `updateProjectV2Field` GraphQL mutation
- Prints a table of role-based views with filter strings for manual setup in the GitHub UI
- Safe to re-run anytime (idempotent)

List all registered teams.

```bash
bm teams list
```

**Behavior:**

- Reads `~/.botminter/config.yml`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--push` | No | Push team repo to GitHub before syncing; also creates workspace repos on GitHub for new members |
| `-v` | No | Show detailed sync status per workspace (submodule updates, file copy decisions, branch state) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Performs schema version guard
- Optionally pushes team repo (`git push`)
- Discovers hired members and configured projects
- For each member: creates or syncs a workspace repo
- New workspace: creates a git repo with `team/` submodule (and `projects/<name>/` submodules), copies context files, assembles agent dir, writes `.gitignore` and `.botminter.workspace` marker
- Existing workspace: updates submodules to latest, checks out member branches, re-copies context files when newer, re-assembles agent dir symlinks, commits and pushes changes
- Reports summary: "Synced N workspaces (M created, K updated)"

## Process lifecycle

### `bm start`

Launch all members.

```bash
bm start [-t <team>] [--formation <name>]
# Alias:
bm up [-t <team>] [--formation <name>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--formation <name>` | No | Formation name (default: `local`) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Checks for `ralph` binary prerequisite
- Maps credentials from config to environment variables
- Discovers member workspaces
- Launches `ralph run -p PROMPT.md` as background process per member
- Records PIDs in `state.json` with atomic writes
- Verifies processes alive after 2 seconds
- For non-local formations: runs the formation manager as a one-shot Ralph session
- Writes a `.topology` file tracking member endpoints

### `bm stop`

Stop all members.

```bash
bm stop [-t <team>] [--force]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--force` | No | Send SIGTERM instead of graceful stop |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Graceful mode (default): runs `ralph loops stop` per member, polls for 60s
- Force mode (`--force`): sends SIGTERM immediately
- Cleans state.json entries
- Suggests `bm stop -f` on graceful failure

### `bm status`

Status dashboard.

```bash
bm status [-t <team>] [-v]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `-v` | No | Show verbose workspace submodule status and Ralph runtime details |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Header shows team name, profile, GitHub repo, and configured projects
- Displays Member, Role, Status, Branch, Started, PID table
- Branch column shows the workspace repo's current git branch (or "—" if no workspace exists)
- Shows daemon status if a daemon is running
- Checks PID liveness via `kill(pid, 0)`
- Auto-cleans crashed entries
- Verbose mode shows per-member submodule status (up-to-date/behind/modified) and queries Ralph CLI commands per running member

## Profile commands

### `bm profiles init`

Extract built-in profiles and Minty config to disk.

```bash
bm profiles init [--force]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--force` | No | Overwrite all existing profiles without prompting |

**Behavior:**

- Extracts all built-in profiles from the `bm` binary to `~/.config/botminter/profiles/`
- Extracts Minty interactive assistant config to `~/.config/botminter/minty/`
- Fresh install (no existing profiles on disk): extracts all without prompting
- Existing profiles with `--force`: overwrites all silently
- Existing profiles without `--force`: prompts per-profile ("Overwrite `<name>`? [y/N]", defaults to No/skip)
- New profiles (added in a newer `bm` version but not yet on disk) are always extracted without prompting
- Minty config is always extracted/updated on every init run

!!! tip "Usually not needed"
    You rarely need to run this command manually. If profiles are missing when you run any profile-reading command (`bm init`, `bm hire`, `bm profiles list`, etc.), BotMinter auto-prompts to initialize them. Use `bm profiles init --force` to reset profiles to their built-in defaults after customization, or to pick up new profiles from a newer `bm` version.

### `bm profiles list`

List available profiles.

```bash
bm profiles list
```

**Behavior:**

- Displays Profile, Version, Schema, and Description columns
- Reads from disk at `~/.config/botminter/profiles/`
- If profiles are not yet initialized, auto-prompts to extract them (see [`bm profiles init`](#bm-profiles-init))

### `bm profiles describe`

Show detailed profile information.

```bash
bm profiles describe <profile> [--show-tags]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<profile>` | Yes | Profile name (e.g., `scrum`) |
| `--show-tags` | No | Show coding-agent dependent files — files containing inline agent tags |

**Behavior:**

- Displays name, version, schema, description
- Lists available roles with descriptions
- Lists all labels with descriptions
- Lists configured coding agents with their file conventions (context_file, agent_dir, binary)
- With `--show-tags`: scans profile files and lists those containing inline agent tags (e.g., `<!-- +agent:claude-code -->`), showing which agents are referenced in each file

## Knowledge management

### `bm knowledge list`

List knowledge and invariant files by scope.

```bash
bm knowledge list [-t <team>] [--scope <scope>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--scope <scope>` | No | Filter by scope: `team`, `project`, `member`, `member-project` |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Lists all knowledge and invariant files in the team repo
- Filters by scope when `--scope` is provided
- Requires schema version 1.0

### `bm knowledge show`

Display the contents of a knowledge or invariant file.

```bash
bm knowledge show <path> [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<path>` | Yes | Path to a knowledge or invariant file (relative to team repo) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Validates the path is under `knowledge/` or `invariants/`
- Rejects path traversal attempts (e.g., `../`)
- Displays file contents

### `bm knowledge` (interactive)

Launch an interactive Claude Code session with the knowledge-manager skill.

```bash
bm knowledge [-t <team>] [--scope <scope>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Spawns a Claude Code session with the knowledge-manager skill injected
- Requires schema version 1.0

## Daemon

### `bm daemon start`

Start the event-driven daemon for a team.

```bash
bm daemon start [-t <team>] [--mode <mode>] [--port <port>] [--interval <interval>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--mode <mode>` | No | `webhook` or `poll` (default: `webhook`) |
| `--port <port>` | No | HTTP listener port for webhook mode (default: `8484`) |
| `--interval <interval>` | No | Poll interval in seconds for poll mode (default: `60`) |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on |

**Behavior:**

- Starts a background daemon process
- **Webhook mode**: listens for GitHub webhook events on the configured port; validates signatures with HMAC-SHA256 if `webhook_secret` is set in credentials
- **Poll mode**: polls the GitHub Events API at the configured interval; tracks poll state in `~/.botminter/daemon-{team}-poll.json`
- Filters events by type: `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`
- Handles both SIGTERM and SIGINT for graceful shutdown
- Daemon log: `~/.botminter/logs/daemon-{team}.log`
- Per-member logs: `~/.botminter/logs/member-{team}-{member}.log` (each member's ralph output is separated)
- Writes PID to `~/.botminter/daemon-{team}.pid` and config to `~/.botminter/daemon-{team}.json`

### `bm daemon stop`

Stop the running daemon for a team.

```bash
bm daemon stop [-t <team>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Sends SIGTERM to the daemon process
- Waits up to 30 seconds for graceful shutdown (the daemon forwards SIGTERM to running members with a 5-second grace period)
- Escalates to SIGKILL if the daemon doesn't exit within 30 seconds
- Cleans up PID, config, and poll state files

See [Daemon Operations](daemon-operations.md) for detailed signal handling behavior and troubleshooting.

### `bm daemon status`

Show daemon status for a team.

```bash
bm daemon status [-t <team>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Reports whether the daemon is running
- Displays mode (webhook/poll), port or interval, and start timestamp

## Shell completions

### `bm completions`

Generate dynamic shell completions.

```bash
bm completions <shell>
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<shell>` | Yes | Shell to generate completions for (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, `elvish`) |

Completions are **dynamic** — tab suggestions include real values from your configuration:

- **Team names** for `-t`/`--team` flags
- **Role names** for `bm hire <role>`
- **Member names** for `bm members show <member>` and `bm chat <member>`
- **Profile names** for `bm profiles describe <profile>`
- **Project names** for `bm projects show <project>`
- **Formation names** for `bm start --formation <formation>`
- **Daemon modes** (`webhook`, `poll`) for `bm daemon start --mode`
- **Knowledge scopes** (`team`, `project`, `member`, `member-project`) for `bm knowledge --scope`

The generated script delegates to the `bm` binary at tab-time, so completions always reflect your current configuration.

**Setup examples:**

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(bm completions bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(bm completions zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== "Fish"

    ```bash
    bm completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/bm.fish
    ```

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    echo 'bm completions powershell | Invoke-Expression' >> $PROFILE
    ```

=== "Elvish"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (bm completions elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
    ```
