# CLI Commands

All botminter operations use the `bm` CLI binary. Install it with `cargo install --path crates/bm` or build with `cargo build -p bm`.

## Team creation

### `bm init`

Interactive wizard — create a new team.

```bash
bm init
```

**Behavior:**

- Prompts for workzone directory, team name, and profile
- Auto-detects GitHub auth from `GH_TOKEN` env var or `gh auth token` — prompts only if none found
- Validates the token via `gh api user` before proceeding
- Lists GitHub orgs and personal account for interactive selection
- Offers to create a new repo or select an existing one from the chosen org
- Offers to create a new GitHub Project board or select an existing one
- For new repos: extracts the profile, optionally hires members and adds projects, creates GitHub repo and pushes
- For existing repos: clones the repo (skips member/project prompts — use `bm hire` and `bm projects add` after init)
- Registers the team in `~/.botminter/config.yml` early (before label/project operations) so a failure doesn't leave config in a broken state
- Bootstraps labels (idempotent via `--force`) and creates/syncs the GitHub Project board's Status field
- Stops with actionable error messages if any GitHub operation fails
- First registered team becomes the default

## Member management

### `bm hire`

Hire a member into a role.

```bash
bm hire <role> [--name <name>] [-t <team>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<role>` | Yes | Role name (must exist in the team's profile, e.g., `architect`) |
| `--name <name>` | No | Member name. Auto-generates a 2-digit suffix (e.g., `01`) if omitted |
| `-t <team>` | No | Team to operate on (defaults to default team) |

**Behavior:**

- Performs schema version guard (rejects if team schema doesn't match embedded profile)
- Extracts member skeleton from the embedded profile into `team/{role}-{name}/`
- Finalizes `botminter.yml` with the member's name
- Creates a git commit (no auto-push)
- Auto-suffix fills gaps: if `01` and `03` exist, returns `02`

### `bm members list`

List hired members for a team.

```bash
bm members list [-t <team>]
```

**Behavior:**

- Scans `team/` directory for member directories

- Workspace sync: pulls repos, re-copies changed files, re-assembles symlinks
- Reports summary: "Synced N workspaces (M created, K updated)"
