# Phase 9 Plan 04: Bridge Documentation Summary

**Bridge concepts page, setup guide, CLI reference updates with bridge commands and --bridge init flag, getting-started and CLAUDE.md updated**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-08T19:39:31Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-08T19:42:43Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- Bridge concepts page covers bridge types (local vs external), per-member identity model, credential flow, formation-aware storage, headless/CI environments, profile bridge declaration, and security considerations
- Bridge setup how-to guide walks through the full init->hire->sync->start journey with bridge configuration
- CLI reference updated with bm bridge commands section, init --bridge flag, and hire bridge token mention
- Getting-started page and CLAUDE.md updated to reflect bridge selection during init
- No references to scrum-compact-telegram in docs or CLAUDE.md
- All 573 tests pass

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Bridge concepts page and setup guide** - `9e5eb93` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Update CLI reference and project CLAUDE.md** - `7a8a798` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `docs/content/concepts/bridges.md` - Bridge concepts page covering types, credential flow, formation-aware storage, security
- `docs/content/how-to/bridge-setup.md` - Step-by-step bridge setup guide
- `docs/mkdocs.yml` - Added Bridges and Bridge Setup nav entries
- `docs/content/reference/cli.md` - Added bm bridge commands section, --bridge flag to init, bridge token mention to hire
- `docs/content/getting-started/index.md` - Added bridge selection mention during init
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated init non-interactive line with --bridge flag

## Decisions Made
- Bridge spec link in concepts page references `.planning/specs/bridge/bridge-spec.md` directly since the spec is not part of the MkDocs site
- Full bm bridge commands section added to CLI reference (status, identity add/rotate/remove, room create/list) rather than just mentioning flags

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 9 documentation complete, all four plans finished
- Bridge abstraction fully documented for operators
- Ready for Phase 10 (Rocket.Chat) when it begins
