# Phase 7 Plan 1: ADR & Specs Foundation Summary

**MADR 4.0.0 ADR practice with 3 accepted ADRs (meta, bridge abstraction, Ralph robot backend) and specs practice with meta-spec defining RFC 2119 conventions**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-08T12:02:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-08T12:07:04Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments
- Established ADR practice with MADR 4.0.0 template and 3 accepted ADRs documenting key architectural decisions
- Created specs practice with meta-spec defining when/how to write specifications using RFC 2119 conformance language
- Removed legacy specs/ directory contents (preserved in git history) and updated all CLAUDE.md references

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create ADR practice infrastructure and write 3 ADRs** - `06e90d1` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Create specs practice and clean up legacy specs/** - Completed by parallel agent in `445b3eb`

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/adrs/adr-template.md` - MADR 4.0.0 template for future ADRs
- `.planning/adrs/README.md` - ADR index listing all 3 ADRs
- `.planning/adrs/0001-adr-process.md` - Meta-ADR documenting ADR practice conventions
- `.planning/adrs/0002-bridge-abstraction.md` - Bridge abstraction design decisions
- `.planning/adrs/0003-ralph-robot-backend.md` - Ralph robot backend credential mapping
- `.planning/specs/README.md` - Spec index listing bridge spec (draft)
- `.planning/specs/meta-spec.md` - Spec discipline definition with RFC 2119 rules
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated references from removed specs/ to .planning/adrs/ and .planning/specs/

## Decisions Made
- MADR 4.0.0 chosen over Nygard-style, Y-statements, or no formal practice
- Bridge abstraction uses shell script + YAML manifest over Rust traits, gRPC, or REST
- Bridge outputs credentials via file-based exchange; BotMinter maps to ralph.yml during sync
- ADRs are immutable -- superseded by new ADRs, never edited after acceptance

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Parallel agent completed Task 2 specs/cleanup work**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (specs practice and cleanup)
- **Issue:** Plan 07-02 parallel agent already created .planning/specs/README.md, meta-spec.md, updated CLAUDE.md, and removed legacy specs/ contents
- **Fix:** Verified the parallel agent's work satisfies all Task 2 requirements; no duplicate commit needed
- **Files affected:** .planning/specs/README.md, .planning/specs/meta-spec.md, CLAUDE.md, specs/
- **Verification:** All must-have artifacts present, no stale references in CLAUDE.md

---

**Total deviations:** 1 (parallel execution overlap)
**Impact on plan:** No impact -- all deliverables present and correct. Task 2 work was completed by the 07-02 plan agent.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- ADR and specs infrastructure in place for Plan 02 (bridge spec) and Plan 03 (conformance tests)
- Template and conventions documented for future ADR/spec authoring
- Bridge spec index entry already lists bridge spec as draft

## Self-Check: PASSED

All 7 created files verified present. Commit 06e90d1 verified in git history.
