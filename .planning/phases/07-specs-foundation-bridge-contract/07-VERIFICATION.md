# Phase 7: Specs Foundation & Bridge Contract Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The bridge plugin contract is formally specified and any developer can read the spec to build a conformant bridge implementation
**Verified:** 2026-03-08T13:30:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (from ROADMAP Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `.planning/adrs/` exists with MADR 4.0.0 template and at least two ADRs | VERIFIED | 5 files: template, README, 0001 (meta), 0002 (bridge abstraction), 0003 (Ralph robot backend). All 3 ADRs have `status: accepted`. Template contains "Context and Problem Statement" (MADR format). |
| 2 | `.planning/specs/bridge/` contains bridge spec with RFC 2119 language defining bridge.yml, schema.json, lifecycle, identity, config exchange | VERIFIED | bridge-spec.md is 367 lines, contains 57 RFC 2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY), references RFC 2119, covers BRIDGE_CONFIG_DIR, Non-goals section present. |
| 3 | A minimal conformance test suite validates whether a bridge implementation satisfies the spec | VERIFIED | `crates/bm/tests/conformance.rs` (268 lines, 7 tests) -- all 7 pass via `cargo test -p bm --test conformance`. Tests validate bridge.yml fields, lifecycle/identity commands, schema.json structure, external bridge distinction. |
| 4 | Prior `specs/` contents (master-plan, milestones, prompts, tasks) removed from tree | VERIFIED | `specs/master-plan/`, `specs/prompts/`, `specs/tasks/`, `specs/presets/`, `specs/design-principles.md` all removed. `specs/milestones/completed/` has untracked local files (not in git tree). No stale references in CLAUDE.md (grep returns empty). |
| 5 | Spec clearly distinguishes local bridges (full lifecycle) from external bridges (identity-only) | VERIFIED | bridge-spec.md covers both types. `examples/bridge.yml` (type: local, has lifecycle+identity). `examples/bridge-external.yml` (type: external, identity-only, no lifecycle). Conformance test `external_bridge_has_no_lifecycle` asserts lifecycle is absent. |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SPEC-01 | 07-01 | ADR practice with MADR 4.0.0 | SATISFIED | Template + 3 ADRs + README index in `.planning/adrs/` |
| SPEC-02 | 07-01 | Bridge abstraction ADR | SATISFIED | `0002-bridge-abstraction.md` accepted |
| SPEC-03 | 07-02 | Bridge spec with RFC 2119 | SATISFIED | `bridge-spec.md` 367 lines, 57 conformance keywords |
| SPEC-04 | 07-03 | Conformance test suite | SATISFIED | 7 tests in `conformance.rs`, all pass |
| SPEC-05 | 07-01 | .planning dirs created, legacy specs/ removed | SATISFIED | Both dirs exist, legacy content removed from git tree |
| BRDG-01 | 07-02 | bridge.yml declares all integration points | SATISFIED | Spec Section 6 defines bridge.yml with all fields |
| BRDG-02 | 07-02 | schema.json validates config | SATISFIED | Spec Section 7 defines schema.json contract |
| BRDG-03 | 07-02 | External bridges skip lifecycle | SATISFIED | Spec Section 5 distinguishes types, conformance test validates |
| BRDG-04 | 07-02 | Identity commands defined | SATISFIED | Spec Section 9 defines onboard/rotate-credentials/remove |
| BRDG-07 | 07-02 | File-based config exchange | SATISFIED | Spec Section 10 defines $BRIDGE_CONFIG_DIR/config.json |

No orphaned requirements -- all 10 Phase 7 requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table are covered.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | - | - | - | No TODOs, FIXMEs, or placeholders found in any phase artifact |

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Bridge Spec Completeness for External Developer

**Test:** Give the bridge spec to a developer unfamiliar with BotMinter and ask them to identify what they'd need to implement a bridge.
**Expected:** Developer can list the required files (bridge.yml, schema.json, Justfile), understand local vs external types, and identify all required commands without ambiguity.
**Why human:** Specification clarity and self-containedness cannot be verified programmatically -- requires a reader's perspective.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 5 success criteria are verified, all 15 artifacts exist and are substantive, all 7 key links are wired, all 10 requirements are satisfied, and all 478 tests pass (327 unit + 49 cli_parsing + 7 conformance + 95 integration). No anti-patterns detected.

Minor note: `specs/milestones/completed/` has untracked files remaining on disk (not in git tree). These are harmless local artifacts but could be cleaned up with `rm -rf specs/milestones/completed/` if desired.
