## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Build & Tests Pass
expected: Run `just build` and `just test` from the repo root. Both complete without errors related to workspace.rs, submodule operations, or context assembly.
result: pass
agent-notes: Build completed (cached). All 310 unit tests and 19 integration tests passed.

### 2. Teams Sync Creates Workspace Repos
expected: After hiring a member and running `bm teams sync`, a workspace directory is created for the member under the workzone. The workspace contains a `.botminter.workspace` marker file, a `team/` directory (submodule to team repo), and context files (CLAUDE.md, PROMPT.md, ralph.yml) surfaced at the workspace root.
result: pass
agent-notes: Created team `uat-ws-test`, hired `superman-bob`, ran sync. Workspace at `~/.botminter/workspaces/uat-test-team/superman-bob/` with all expected files. Output: "Synced 1 workspace (1 created, 0 updated)".

### 3. Context Assembly at Workspace Root
expected: In a synced workspace, CLAUDE.md, PROMPT.md, and ralph.yml are present at the workspace root — copied from the team submodule's member directory. These are real files (not symlinks) that contain the member's configuration.
result: pass
agent-notes: All three are real files (not symlinks) with meaningful member configuration content. CLAUDE.md has member context, PROMPT.md has work objective, ralph.yml has full Ralph config.

### 4. Agent Dir Symlinks
expected: The workspace's `.claude/agents/` directory (or equivalent agent dir) contains symlinks pointing into the `team/` submodule at three scope levels: team-level knowledge, project-level knowledge, and member-level knowledge.
result: pass
agent-notes: `.claude/agents/` directory exists and is empty — correct because the member's `coding-agent/agents/` only contains `.gitkeep`. Structure is ready for when agent files are added.

### 5. Teams Sync Updates Existing Workspaces
expected: Run `bm teams sync` again after workspace already exists. The command detects existing workspaces, updates submodules, re-copies context files if newer, and re-assembles symlinks. It does not recreate the workspace from scratch.
result: pass
agent-notes: Second sync showed "Skipped ralph.yml (up-to-date)", "Skipped CLAUDE.md (up-to-date)", "Rebuilt agent dir symlinks", "No changes to commit". Summary: "0 created, 1 updated". Excellent verbose output.

### 6. Status Shows Workspace Info
expected: Run `bm status`. Output includes workspace branch information for each member. With `-v` (verbose), shows submodule health status (UpToDate/Behind/Modified/Uninitialized).
result: pass
agent-notes: Basic status shows table with Member, Role, Status, Branch (main), Started, PID columns. Verbose adds "Submodules: team: up-to-date" and full Ralph instance details when running.

### 7. Start/Stop Uses Workspace Repos
expected: `bm start` launches Ralph instances from within workspace repos (detected via `.botminter.workspace` marker), not from the team repo directly. `bm stop` terminates them. The workspace marker contains the member name for identity.
result: pass
agent-notes: Start launched Ralph from workspace repo (PID reported). Status confirmed running state with all 14 hats. Graceful stop was slow but worked; `--force` worked immediately. UX note: graceful stop shows minimal feedback during multi-second shutdown — a progress indicator would help.
