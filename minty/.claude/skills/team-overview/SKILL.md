# Team Overview

Shows registered BotMinter teams with their members, roles, workspaces, and running state.

## Data Sources

| Source | Path | Contains |
|--------|------|----------|
| Team registry | `~/.botminter/config.yml` | Team names, paths, profiles, GitHub repos, credentials |
| Team repo | `<team-path>/team/` | Member configs, knowledge, invariants |
| Member config | `<team-path>/team/members/<member>/` | ralph.yml, PROMPT.md, CLAUDE.md |
| Workspace | `<team-path>/<member>/` | Workspace repo with `.botminter.workspace` marker |

## How to List Teams

Read the team registry:

```bash
cat ~/.botminter/config.yml
```

Parse the YAML to extract team entries. Each team has:
- `name` — team identifier
- `path` — local filesystem path to the team directory
- `profile` — which profile the team uses (e.g., `scrum`, `scrum-compact`)
- `github_repo` — the GitHub repo URL for coordination
- `credentials.gh_token` — GitHub token (do NOT display this)

### No Teams Configured

If `~/.botminter/config.yml` does not exist or has no teams, tell the operator:

> No teams registered yet. To create a team, run `bm init`.

## How to List Members

For each team, read the members directory:

```bash
ls <team-path>/team/members/
```

Each subdirectory is a member. To get member details, read their config:

```bash
cat <team-path>/team/members/<member>/ralph.yml
```

This shows their hat collection (roles they can perform) and Ralph Orchestrator configuration.

## How to Check Running State

Check if members have active Ralph processes by looking for lock files:

```bash
cat <team-path>/<member>/.ralph/loop.lock 2>/dev/null
```

If the lock file exists and contains a PID, the member is running. If it does not exist, the member is stopped.

Alternatively, use the CLI:

```bash
bm status -t <team-name>
```

## How to Check Workspace State

Verify a member's workspace is provisioned:

```bash
test -f <team-path>/<member>/.botminter.workspace && echo "provisioned" || echo "not provisioned"
```

If not provisioned, suggest:

```bash
bm teams sync -t <team-name>
```

## Output Format

Present the overview as a structured summary:

```
## Teams

### <team-name>
- **Profile:** <profile>
- **GitHub:** <github-repo>
- **Path:** <team-path>

| Member | Role | Workspace | Running |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| alice  | architect | provisioned | stopped |
| bob    | developer | provisioned | running |
