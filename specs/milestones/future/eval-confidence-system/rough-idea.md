# Deferred: Eval/Confidence System

> Originally Milestone 4, now Milestone 5 in the master plan. Remains deferred.

## Scope

Formalizes the distributed eval framework across recursive scopes. Hard-gate vs advisory evals. HIL graduation path.

## Why Deferred

Requires practical multi-member team experience to inform the eval design. The eval framework should emerge from observed failure modes, not theoretical analysis.
