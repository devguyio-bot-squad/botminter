# Invariant: Code Review Required

All changes to the codebase require code review before merging.

## Rules

1. No direct commits to the main branch
2. Every change must go through a pull request
3. At least one team member must approve the PR before merge
4. The author cannot approve their own PR
5. Review comments must be resolved before approval

## Rationale

Code review catches defects early, spreads knowledge across the team, and
ensures consistent code quality. Designs must include a review step in their
workflow to comply with this invariant.
